      <h1>Project description GetActiveTogether</h1>
      <p>This app was created for the module web-engeneering at the FHNW in HS20 by <abbr title="Thierry Odermatt">19-487-388</abbr>.</p>
      <p>GetActiveTogether allows you to see a list of locations, on which you can create meetups for doing sports together. Each location contains a title, coordinates and an activity type.
        On each location, you can see who already created meetups and under people you can see all meetups of a specific person. When creating a new meetup,
        the app allows you to choose between five diffrent timeslots each day, which work as a starting point for the choosen activity.</p>

      <h4>Workflow:</h4>
      <p>Every user can create, read, update and delete meetups, locations and people. Users can see all participants of a specific location and of their own meetups.</p>

      <p>Sidenote: grailsw test-app seems to not work, the following message is shown: "test framework quit unexpectedly". I tried out a lot and searched but I can't find the problem.
        All tests run perfectly if they are started directly or with <code>grailsw test-app --unit</code> and <code>grailsw test-app --integration</code>.</p>
