      <h1>Project description GetActiveTogether</h1>
      <p>This app was created for the module web-engineering at the FHNW in HS20 by <abbr title="Thierry Odermatt">19-487-388</abbr>.</p>
      <p>GetActiveTogether allows you to see a list of locations, on which you can create meetups for doing sports together. Each location contains a title, coordinates and an activity type.
        On each location, you can see who already created meetups and under people you can see all meetups of a specific person. When creating a new meetup,
        the app allows you to choose between five different timeslots each day for a week in advance, which work as a starting point for the chosen activity.</p>

      <h4>Workflow:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Every user can create, read, update and own meetups, locations, timeslots and people.</li>
        <li>Users can see all participants of a specific location and of their own meetups.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem">Security: only as "admin" you can access the "Admin-Page" and see all meetups created by all users.</li>
        <li>Through the "Admin-Page" on the bottom-left, you can access all controller and pages.</li>
      </ul>
